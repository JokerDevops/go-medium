Go encourages developers to handle errors explicitly for the following reasons:

Safety: Error handling ensures that unexpected issues don’t cause the program to panic or crash abruptly.
Clarity: Explicit error handling makes your code more readable and helps identify where errors may occur.
Debugging: Handling errors provides valuable information for debugging and troubleshooting.
Let’s create a simple program that reads a file and handles errors properly:
